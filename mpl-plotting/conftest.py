# To run tests, install pytest via e.g. pip and then run
# `python -m pytest` from this directory (not in the test/ directory!)
# This file is currently only here to make pytest work without import errors. 
# This file should be removed in the future once rivet_plot.py file etc. are moved to the pyext/rivet/ directory, since they will then be added to the python path.
