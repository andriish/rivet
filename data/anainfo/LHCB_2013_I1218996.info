Description:
  'Measurements of differential production cross-sections with respect to
   transvers momentum, $d \sigma(H_c + \mathrm{c.c}) / d p_T$, for charm
   hadron species
   $H_c \in \left{ D^0, D^+, D^{\ast}(2010)^+, D_s^+, \Lambda_c^$ \right}$
   in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energy
   \mbox{$\sqrt{s}= 7$ TeV}.

   The differential cross-sections are measured in bins of hadron transverse
   momentum ($p_T$) and rapidity ($y$) with respect to the beam axis
   in the region \mbox{$0 < p_T < 8\,\mathrm{GeV}/c} and \mbox{$2.0 < y < 4.5$},
   where $p_T$ and $y$ are measured in the proton-proton CM frame.
   In writing this Rivet plug-in, we assumed that the event coordinate
   system is in the proton-proton CM frame with the z-axis corresponding to the
   proton-proton collision axis.  No coordinate transformations are implemented
   within the plug-in.

   Contributions of charm hadrons from the decays of b-hadrons and other
   particles with comparably large mean lifetimes have been removed in the
   measurement.  In the Rivet plug-in, this is implemented by counting only
   charm hadrons that do not have an ancestor that contains a b quark.'
