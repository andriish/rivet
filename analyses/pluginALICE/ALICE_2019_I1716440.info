Description:
  'Measurement of the transverse momentum spectra and ratios for  $D^0$, $D^{*\pm}$, $D^\pm$ and $D^\pm_s$ meson production at 5.02 TeV by the ALICE collaboration. The 7 TeV results are based on those from ALICE_2017_I1511870 and are mainly used to take ratios between the two energies.
  Beam energy must be specified as analysis option "ENERGY" when rivet-merging samples.'
