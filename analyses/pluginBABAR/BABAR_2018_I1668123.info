Description:
  'Measurement of Kinematic distributions in the decay $D^0\to K^0_S\pi^+\pi^-$ by BABAR and BELLE. The data were read from the plots in the paper.
   Resolution/acceptance effects have been not unfolded.'
ValidationInfo:
  'Compared Herwig events using the same model for the decay as in the paper.'
