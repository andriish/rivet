Summary: Dalitz plot analysis of $\eta_c\to K^0_SK^\pm\pi^\mp$ and $\eta_c\to K^+K^-\pi^0$
Experiment: BABAR
Collider: PEP-II
InspireID: 1403544
Status: VALIDATED 
Reentrant: true
Authors:

RunInfo: Any process producing eta_c (originally gamma gamma -> eta_c)
Description:
  'Measurement of the mass distributions in the decays $\eta_c\to K^0_SK^\pm\pi^\mp$ and $\eta_c\to K^+K^-\pi^0$ by BaBar. The data were read from the plots in the paper and therefore for some points the error bars are the size of the point. Also the sideband background from the plots has been subtracted. It is also not clear that any resolution effects have been unfolded.'
ValidationInfo:
  'Herwig 7 events using model from paper'
Description:
  'A brief description of what is measured and what it is useful for.
   Use LaTeX for maths, e.g. $\pT > 50\;\GeV$.'
ValidationInfo:
  'A description of the process used to validate the Rivet code against
  the original experimental analysis. Cut-flow tables and similar information
  are welcome'
