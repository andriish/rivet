Summary:  Dalitz plot analysis of $D^0\to K^0_S\pi^+\pi^-$
Experiment: BELLE
Collider: KEKB
InspireID: 1289224
Status: VALIDATED NOHEPDATA
Reentrant: true

RunInfo: Any process producing D0
Description:
  'Measurement of Kinematic distributions  in the decays $D^0\to K^0_S\pi^+\pi^-$ by BELLE. The data were read from the plots in the paper and for many points the errors are given by the size of the point.
   Resolution/acceptance effects have been not unfolded.'
ValidationInfo:
  'Compared Herwig events using the same model for the decay as in the paper.'
