Description:
  'Measurement of the differential cross section for $\gamma\gamma\to\eta\pi^0$ for $0.84 \text{GeV} < W < 4.0 \text{GeV}$. Both the cross section as a function of the centre-of-mass energy of the photonic collision, and the differential cross section with respect to the pion scattering angle are measured.'
