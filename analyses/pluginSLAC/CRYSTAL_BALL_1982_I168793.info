Description:
  'Measurement of the differential cross section for $\gamma\gamma\to \pi^0\pi^0$ for $0.72 \text{GeV} < W < 1.8 \text{GeV}$. Both the cross section as a function of the centre-of-mass energy of the photonic collision, and the differential cross section with respect to the kaon scattering angle are measured.'
