Description:
  'Measurement of the differential cross section for $\gamma\gamma\to p \bar{p}$ for $2 \text{GeV} < W < 3.25 \text{GeV}$. Both the cross section as a function of the centre-of-mass energy of the photonic collision, and the differential cross section with respect to the proton scattering angle are measured.'
