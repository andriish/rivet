Description:
  'The double differential cross sections of the Drell-Yan lepton pair ($\ell^+\ell^-$, dielectron or dimuon) production are measured, as functions of the invariant mass $m_{\ell\ell}$, transverse momentum $p_T^{\ell\ell}$, and $\varphi^*_\eta$. The $\varphi^*_\eta$ observable, derived from angular measurements of the leptons and highly correlated with $p_T^{\ell\ell}$, is used to probe the low-$p_T^{\ell\ell}$ region in a complementary way. Dilepton masses up to 1 TeV are investigated. Additionally, a measurement is performed requiring at least one jet in the final state. To benefit from partial cancellation of the systematic uncertainty, the ratios of the differential cross sections for various $m_{\ell\ell}$ ranges to those in the Z mass peak interval are presented. The collected data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 36.3 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. Measurements are compared with predictions based on perturbative quantum chromodynamics, including soft-gluon resummation.'
