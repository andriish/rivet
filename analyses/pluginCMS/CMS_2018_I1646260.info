Description:
  'A search is presented for new physics in events with two low-momentum, oppositely
  charged leptons (electrons or muons) and missing transverse momentum in proton-proton
  collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13â€¯TeV. The data collected using the CMS
  detector at the LHC correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9/fb. The observed
  event yields are consistent with the expectations from the Standard Model. The
  analysis is optimised for study of pair production of charginos and neutralinos
  with nearly degenerate masses, as expected in natural supersymmetry models with light
  higgsinos, as well as in terms of the pair production of top squarks, when the lightest
  neutralino and the top squark have similar masses.'
ValidationInfo:
  'Validated for the published EWino cutflows using 250k MG5 events generated with the
  CMS simplified model used in the paper. Cutflow for (150,142.5) benchmark:
