Description:
  'Kinematic distributions  in the decay $D^+\to \to K^+K^-\pi^+$'
ValidationInfo:
  'Compared Herwig events using the same model for the decay as in the paper. The data were read from the plots in the paper.
   Resolution/acceptance effects have been not unfolded. Given the agreement with the model in the paper this analysis should only be used for qualitative studies.'
