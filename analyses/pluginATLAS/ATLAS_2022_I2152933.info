Description:
  'A measurement of observables sensitive to effects of colour reconnection in top-quark 
  pair-production events is presented using 139 fb$^{-1}$ of 13 TeV proton--proton collision data 
  collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Events are selected by requiring exactly one 
  isolated electron and one isolated muon with opposite charge and two or three jets, 
  where exactly two jets are required to be $b$-tagged. For the selected events, 
  measurements are presented for the charged-particle multiplicity, 
  the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the charged particles, 
  and the same scalar sum in bins of charged-particle multiplicity.  
  These observables are unfolded to the stable-particle level, thereby correcting 
  for migration effects due to finite detector resolution, acceptance and efficiency effects. 
  The particle-level measurements are compared with different colour reconnection models 
  in Monte Carlo generators. These measurements disfavour some of the colour 
  reconnection models and provide inputs to future optimisation of the parameters in 
  Monte Carlo generators.'
