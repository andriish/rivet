Description: 'A new measurement of the proton structure function $F_2(x,Q^2)$ is reported for momentum transfers squared $Q^2$ between 1.5 and 5000 GeV$^2$  and for Bjorken x between $3\cdot 10^{-5}$ and $0.32$ using data collected by the HERA experiment H1 in 1994. The data represent an increase in statistics by a factor of ten with respect to the analysis of the 1993 data. Substantial extension of the kinematic range towards low $Q^2$ and $x$ has been achieved using dedicated data samples and events with initial state photon radiation. The structure function is found to increase significantly with decreasing xxx, even in the lowest accessible $Q^2$ region.'
ValidationInfo: 'Rivet plugin validated against corresponding plugin from HZTool. Note, that Q2-bins were not defined in Hepdata, for the plugin they are defined (as in HZTool) by hand from the Q2 distribution. The x-bins were defined according to the correspnding x-ranges. Be aware, the hepdata file needed manual adjustment to be useful in the plugin.'
