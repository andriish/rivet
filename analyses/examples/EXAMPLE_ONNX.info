Description:
  'An example demonstrating the preservation of a neural net in Rivet using ONNX.
  The network (stored in EXAMPLE_ONNX.onnx in standard onnx format) in this case
  takes the pT and eta of the three lead jets, and produces a totally irrelevant
  number, just for proof of principle, which is plotted in a histogram.'
  Almost identical to EXAMPLE_LWTNN, but the networks are not equivalent.
Keywords: ['onnx']
